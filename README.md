# Leads---Chrome-Extension

Started Scrimba Intro to JavaScript Course. May end up doing their bootcamp as I really like the way it is taught: interactive, code reviews, community to bounce problems off of... All things AppAcademy does not offer.  

Also, very excited to learn how to build chrome extensions. Lots of real world easy to fix problems. May start super niche for recruiting/sales/3pl.
